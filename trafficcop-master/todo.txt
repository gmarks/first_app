BUYERCHAT
	how do we know if it can work?
		# of chats to expect
			# of chats from potential buyers w/o an agent
				# has to be worth agent's time --> target, sell on keeping in background while they do other stuff
	conversion funnel
		need to know:
			how many times chat should have appeared --> page served with that zip 
				fire off event if we serve page when operator is online and zip is there
			how many times chat does appear 
				on_before_load --> js loaded, before chat window appears
				on_after_load --> after chat box appears
			window opened
				on_chat_window_opened --> after window opens
			did they chat?
				pull from chat api, by operator
				need to know add details in chat log, so we can match up with the chats
		
	how to set up:

	http://www.livechatinc.com/kb/dividing-livechat-by-department/
	
	agent needs to sign up for zip(s)
		upload pic
			WHAT'S THE RIGHT HANDOFF TO THEIR LOGIN VS OURS?
			THEY/WE HAVE TO UPLOAD IN LIVECHAT
				either can
		set password
			how to reset? - THROUGH LIVECHAT
		can't change skill - CORRECT
		will the agent get the email if we create their account through the API?
			SHOULD, BUT NOT WORKING
		operators should only be able to see themselves
			OPERATORS CAN ONLY SEE OTHER OPERATORS IN THEIR OWN SKILL
				- set the skill to be operator specific
	manual fulfillment steps
		- add skill to operator
		- add avatar to operator
		
	STUFF TO DO TO HAVE JEN TEST

			- would she pay for it?
			- how may chats does she get?
			- how many potential buyers does she get?
		
		stuff to do
			- hide when she's not logged in
			- create account for her
x			- customize chat box colors, etc.
			- show on search results or details pages when that zip is active
			- 99501
			- let jen know
		
		questions for jen:
			- would you pay for a whole month, exclusive access?
			- what does she want to know up front in the questionaire?
			
		questions for us:
			- how do we make sure we've got enough coverage?  should we sell multiple agents per zip?
				- we could, and make precedence based on feedback rating
				- how do we charge?
			- should we give credits if they get a certain positive rating?
